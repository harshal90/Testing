Task 2.

Answer the questions below. Write your answers in a file answers.txt and put it into the
same repository as the result of task 1.

1. What test design techniques would you use to test a feature which grants user access
to certain resources depending on their age? For example: if a user is older than XX then
access granted.

-- Boundry Value Analysis


2. Given two web services: A and B. Service A is calling service B and expects a response
with HTTP code 200 (OK).
Sometimes due to internal problems in service B, it responds with HTTP code 500 
(Internal server error).
Your task is to test that service A handles this 500 response gracefully (doesn't crash and
logs the error).
How would you do it

-- Create custom exception for service B to handle 500 error code
-- Then service B can send a message with response that server is not responding.
